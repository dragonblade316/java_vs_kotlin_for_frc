# java_vs_kotlin_for_frc

This is an expeariment where I put java ageinst kotlin to see as objectivly as posable which is generally better for frc and if kotlin is worth using as a main or secondary tool. 

I did my programing in intellij idea bc i have been using it for other stuff lately and like its intellisence better.

my current knowlage:
I have helped with coding robots in java and have done little with kotlin other then bubble sort and some research. (java has a large advantage)

setup:
without a timer I went ahead and got both command based projects set up nether took much longer then the other except when I built both to ensure there were no error the kotlin build took considerably longer

goal: i will be implmenting mecanum drive in both langs using our 2021-2022 bot code as a reference (yes this does give java even more an advantage then it already hadsince that is what are robot code is made with).


maybe subtract 5 to 6 mins from java bc I was an idiot and did not realize CANsparkmax implmented MotorContoller and tried to implment it myself


it took roughly 25 minutes (30 if you include me being dumb as I said above) to do the project in java

kotlin has the largest advantage so far that I already know how to implment the robot code so this should level out any advantages java had


kotlin won on the speed of coding but not by much landing on 23 mins and 26 seconds though this should be rounded up to 24 mins.
In a nontimed envirment this would probably go up by a couple minutes since I was coding as fast as posable in kotlin.

I did not use a super consistint style on ether project

nether did considerably better then the other.

java was familier.
kotlin was a fun expeariment

I like kotlins command and subsystem programing better then java but found robotContainer a bit difficult to understand and modify.

In the real world what I might do is create the project in java and do command and subsystem programing in kotlin.

also you might want to get a habit of putting private before variables bc they are public by default in kotlin.
